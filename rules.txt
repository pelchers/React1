# Project Rules and Notes

1. Always reference the `.env` and `.gitignore` files for environment variables and ignored files.
2. Use bash for executing terminal commands.
3. Keep code simple, well-documented, and structured.
4. For any placeholders in code, decide on the values or ask for guidance.
5. Use the `src/index.js` file as the main entry point for your server.
6. Ensure all sensitive information is stored in the `.env` file and not committed to version control.
7. Regularly update log files in the `logs` directory to track commands, syntax, errors, and ease of use considerations.
8. Use `\du` in PostgreSQL CLI to list all users and verify your username.
9. Confirm each step before proceeding to the next to ensure understanding and completion.
10. Follow a structured approach with prior, current, and next step indications.
11. Use the naming guide for steps: [Prior Step: Step X - Name] [Current Step: Step Y - Name] [Next Step: Step Z - Name].
12. Ensure the database name is consistent across all configurations, using `React1` for this project.

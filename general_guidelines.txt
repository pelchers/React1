# General Guidelines

## Terminal Usage
- Use bash for executing terminal commands.
- Specify whether commands should be run in an admin terminal or a normal one.

## Editable Sections
- Use ***EDIT THIS*** before any code or command that requires user customization.
- Replace placeholders with your credentials or specific values.

## Code Structure
- Keep code simple, well-documented, and structured.
- Use `.tsx` files for React components to ensure type safety.

## File Management
- Always reference the `.env` and `.gitignore` files for environment variables and ignored files.
- Ensure all sensitive information is stored in the `.env` file and not committed to version control.

## Development Practices
- Use the `src/index.js` file as the main entry point for your server.
- Follow best practices in code organization, security, and version control.
